  <p> I'm interested in developing my own website, and considering a career in web design and development or coding apps.
     These are exciting fields with plenty of room to be creative and innovative! In this module, we'll start with the basics - HTML and CSS - and
    then learn how to integrate data and add fun user interactions into your site by writing conditionals, loops and functions using Javascript. No experience required.

  <h2><i>You Can Help Fulfill Grace Hopper’s Vision!</i></h2>

  <p>
  Grace Hopper is widely recognized as one of the most influential pioneers of computer science.
  She was a visionary, an inventor, an educator, and an advocate.
  Anyone who develops software today can see in Hopper’s work the origins of key principles and patterns that
  are fundamental to modern programming languages.
  She was one of the first programmers on the first computers in the United States, the <strong>Harvard Mark I.</strong>
